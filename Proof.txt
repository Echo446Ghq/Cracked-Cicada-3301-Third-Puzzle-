This file serves as proof of authorship and timing for the cryptographic breakthroughs disclosed by Echo446 (GitHub: Echo446Ghq), including the full solution to the Cicada 3301 final puzzle and the decryption of the Lake City Quiet Pills (LCQP) archive.

All materials in this repository were created independently. The methodology behind both breakthroughs was based entirely on cryptanalytic reasoning, systematic pattern recognition, and reproducible logic.

The complete decrypted LCQP archive will be released once the funding target of $15,000 (USD equivalent in BTC) is met.
